 # Welcome - Your Data Science Internship begins
 Congratulations! You have just been hired as a Data Scientist Intern at CodeBook 
The Social Media for Coders. This Delhi-based company is offering you a ₹10 LPA
 job if you successfully complete this 1-month internship. But before you get there,
 you must prove your skills using only Python—no pandas, NumPy, or fancy
 libraries!
 Your manager Puneet Kumar has assigned you your first task: analyzing a data
 dump of CodeBook users using pure Python. Your job is to load and explore the
 data to understand its structure.
